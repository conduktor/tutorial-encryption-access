# Contract Pipeline Tutorial

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how Conduktor Gateway can manage data encryption and access within a single pipeline. The situation is this: marketing, engineering, and sales all need up-to-date information about completed contracts, but with different encryption requirements.

To achieve this we're going to use interceptors from Conduktor Gateway and access rights from Conduktor Console.

Through building the contract pipeline you will learn how Conduktor Gateway and Conduktor Console can seamlessly handle data encryption and access for multiple teams, ensuring data consistency and security.
